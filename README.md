h1 Mathirl ReadMe
--------
Mathril is a Mithril-based lightweight spreadsheet that can handle simple
calculations. Right now it is a complete knockoff of the spreadsheet discussed
at http://lhorie.github.io/mithril-blog/a-spreadsheet-in-60-lines-of-javascript.html.

I REALLY suggest folks check out the Mithril mvc framework. Lightweight, intuitive,
and definitely does not get in your way.
